# Olist E-commerce Analytics Pipeline

An end-to-end **SQL-driven data warehousing and analytics pipeline** built using the Olist public e-commerce dataset.  
This project demonstrates how real companies ingest, clean, transform, and analyze incremental transactional data for business insights.

---

## Project Overview

This pipeline is designed to:

- Ingest **daily incremental Olist data via API**
- Store data in a **PostgreSQL raw layer**
- Clean and structure data into a **clean layer**
- Transform it into a **business-ready star schema**
- Connect the business layer to **Power BI dashboards** for analytics

The objective is to showcase **practical SQL, ETL design, and BI integration** in an industry-style workflow.

## Data Layers

### **Raw Layer**
Stores the original API data exactly as received for traceability and incremental loading.

### **Clean Layer**
Standardizes and prepares data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and establishing relationships.

### **Business Layer**
Transforms cleaned data into a **star-schema warehouse** and calculates key business metrics for analysis.
